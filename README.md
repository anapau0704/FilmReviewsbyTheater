# Data Analysis of Films Playing in Austin in February 2022

## Data Collection and Curation 
**Goal of the project:**
The aim of this data analysis is to compare how the ratings of audience members differ between the films showing in theaters in February 2022 and between different movie theaters around Austin, Texas. The data for this analysis was collected by interviewing audiences after different film screenings across different movie theaters. The data collection was carried out from February 10th-13th, so the films represent those in theathers during these dates. 

**Description of each Attribute:**

Theater: Describes the theater location that was visited to produce the data. The data in this attribute is nominal. Three different locations were visited, resulting in three labels:

-  Alamo Drafthouse located at 1120 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704
-  AMC Barton Creek Square 14 located at 2901 S Capital of Texas Hwy, Austin, TX 78746
-  IPIC Theaters located at 3225 Amy Donovan Plaza, Austin, TX 78758.

Film: Describes the movie that is being rated by audiences (Note: It describes the film and not the specific screening- so not for a specific place and time). The data within this attribute is nominal. The films rated throughout the data collection, or the possible labels, are:

-  Death on the Nile (2022) directed by Kenneth Branagh
-  Moonfall (2022) directed by Roland Emmerich
-  Scream (2022) directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett
-  Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) directed by Jon Watts
-  Marry Me (2022) directed by Kat Coiro
-  Sing 2 (2021) directed by Garth Jennings
-  Licorice Pizza (2021) directed by Paul Thomas Anderson
-  Blacklight (2022) directed by Mark Williams.

Rating: Describes the score given to the films by audiences. The scale is out of 5 (and includes half ratings like out of 5 stars). The data within this attribute is ordinal. 

Age: Describes the age of the audience participant interviewed. Data here is nominal and collected with the purpose of gathering demographic data.

Gender: Describes the gender identification of participants (who were asked). Data here is nominal and collected with the purpose of gathering demographic data.

**Licence:**
Data is original data and did not require use of an API. 

**Potential Issues:**

An important factor to consider is the fact that there is an insufficient number of data point (or people interviewed). Data on the small scale, such as the one presented for the purposes of this project, may not be accurate compared to data gathered at a larger scale and over a longer period of time. That said, the assumptions about audiences in the different movie theaters or the conclusions about audience reactions (based on the sample's ratings) may be erroneous if analyzed with more information. 
It should also be noted that there is potential bias in the data collection, which stems from the people who were chosen to participate. Not all audience members were interviewed after each screening. The selection was random and opportunity based.
